    <center><h1>Why are beagles the best dog?</h1>
    <h2>Out of all dogs, you should get a beagle</h2></center>
    <h3>This is because...</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>They are very playful</li>
        <li>They can be trained<b>-</b>it takes time<b>-</b>to sit, stay, paw, and <b>MORE!</b></li>
        <li>They can sleep in your once house-trained</li>
        <li>They are very friendly! Sometimes a little to much that they accidently bite you!</li>
        <li>They make you very happy</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>But here are some cons...</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>They can bite, hard</li>
        <li>You need to excersise them often</li>
        <li>You need a fenced-in backyard</li>
        <li>They can sometimes wake up early</li>
        <li>Unless trained, they could eat harmful things</li>
    </ol>
